This website was designed for a class project where we had to create a novel idea using an Adafruit NeoKey Trinkey (A USB circuit board with a key switch and an LED light). My idea was a button/app combo that would alert you of upcoming meetings and launch the meeting with the press of a button. To present the idea to my class I created a product website to showcase its features and market the idea.
