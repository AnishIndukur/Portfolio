A look through the interesting projects I've gotten to work on through my educational and work experiences. 

## [COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Classification] (Portfolio/COVID 19 PROJECT)
I trained a convolutional neural network on a dataset of chest X-ray scans. The goal was to create a classifier that would reliably recognize scans that came from a COVID-19 patient over scans from a patient with viral pneumonia and normal scans. The final model reached an accuracy of 87.8%, precision of 88.5%, recall of 87.8%. The model was able to recognize all the covid scans, and only confused 1 pneumonia scan with covid.
