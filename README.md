A look through the interesting projects I've gotten to work on through my educational and work experiences. 

## [COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Classification](Portfolio/COVID_19_PROJECT/)
I trained a convolutional neural network on a dataset of chest X-ray scans. The goal was to create a classifier that would reliably recognize scans that came from a COVID-19 patient over scans from a patient with viral pneumonia and normal scans. The final model reached an accuracy of 87.8%, precision of 88.5%, recall of 87.8%. The model was able to recognize all the COVID scans and only confused one pneumonia scan with COVID.

## [EventGlow Website](https://gregarious-pixie-d08e41.netlify.app/)
This website was designed for a class project where we had to create a novel idea using an Adafruit NeoKey Trinkey (A USB circuit board with a key switch and an LED light). My idea was a button/app combo that would alert you of upcoming meetings and launch the meeting with the press of a button. To present the idea to my class, I created a product website to showcase its features and market the idea.
