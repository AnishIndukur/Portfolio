A look through the interesting projects I've gotten to work on through my educational and work experiences. 

## [COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Classification](Portfolio/COVID_19_PROJECT/)
I trained a convolutional neural network on a dataset of chest X-ray scans. The goal was to create a classifier that would reliably recognize scans that came from a COVID-19 patient over scans from a patient with viral pneumonia and normal scans. The final model reached an accuracy of 87.8%, precision of 88.5%, recall of 87.8%. The model was able to recognize all the COVID scans and only confused one pneumonia scan with COVID.

## [EventGlow Website](https://gregarious-pixie-d08e41.netlify.app/)
I designed this website using HTML and CSS to present my idea for a class project where we had to create a novel idea using an Adafruit NeoKey Trinkey (A USB circuit board with a key switch and an LED light). My idea was a button/app combo that would alert you of upcoming meetings and launch the meeting with the press of a button. Visit the website to learn more about the idea!

## [Plant Seedling Classification](Portfolio/Plant_Seedling_Classification.ipynb)
A class project where I trained a convolutional neural network and performed hyperparameter tuning with multiple activation functions to assess differences between them. Using the neural network I achieved >75% accuracy classifying a large dataset of plant seedling images.

## [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](Portfolio/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
I performed sentiment analysis on tweets directed at six major airline companies to see which airlines have the best and worst relationships with their customers. I then used multiple approaches (Tf_Idf, CountVectorizer, Word2Vec) to vectorize the tweets and train an ML model that could gauge the sentiment of the tweet (Negative-Positive Reviews). Such a solution can be employed en-masse to quickly evaluate how customers feel about the services offered and which are the most common pain points.

## [Ensemble_Models_Project](Portfolio/Ensemble_Models_Project.ipynb)
I analyzed customer data from a travel agency to extract business insights as to which products appeal to their target demographic and where they should direct marketing resources. I then used multiple ensemble ML techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, AdaBoost, XGBoost) to create a classifier that could predict which product a certain customer would choose.
